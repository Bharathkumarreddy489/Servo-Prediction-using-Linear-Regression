# Servo-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
# What is Servo : In control engineering a servomechanism, usually shortened to servo, is an automatic device that uses error-sensing negative feedback to correct the action of a mechanism. On displacement-controlled applications, it usually includes a built-in encoder or other position feedback mechanism to ensure the output is achieving the desired effect. The term correctly applies only to systems where the feedback or error-correction signals help control mechanical position, speed, attitude or any other measurable variables. For example, an automotive power window control is not a servomechanism, as there is no automatic feedback that controls positionâ€”the operator does this by observation. Bycontrast a car's cruise control uses closed-loop feedback, which classifies it as a servomechanism.

#  A data frame with 167 observations on 5 variables, 4 nominal and 1 as the target class. This data set is from a simulation of a servo system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a sliding carriage of some sort. It may have been on of the translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the A1 lab. In any case, the output value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set point. The variables that describe the data set and their values are the following:
1. Motor - A,B,C,D,E
2. Screw - A,B,C,D,E
3. Pgain - 3,4,5,6
4. vgain - 1,2,3,4,5
5. Class 0.13 to 7.10
